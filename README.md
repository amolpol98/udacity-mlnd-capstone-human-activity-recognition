# MLND_Capstone
Capstone project for Machine learning Nanodegree at Udacity

## Introduction

In this project, I have built two models - RF model and a deep learning model - RNN (LSTM) model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.

## Required Libary
 - numpy
 - pandas
 - seaborn
 - sklearn
 - matplotlib
 - prettytable
 - tensorflow
 - keras

## Running
The entire code is under following ipython notebooks
EDA.ipynb
PREDICTION_RF.ipynb
PREDICTION_LSTM.ipynb

## Data
Dataset is present in "UCI HAR Dataset.zip".
Dataset also available here - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones

## Final result
Using RF model, I am getting accuracy ~ 91%.
Using Deep Leraning model - RNN (LSTM), I am getting accuracy ~ 92%.
